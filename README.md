# FIBONACCI-GENERATOR

*COMPANY*: HEX SOFTWARE

*NAME*: TANVI DHULE

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: KAPTAN

*DESCRIPTION*: 
This is a simple Python-based project that generates the Fibonacci Series, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. For example:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
In this project, the user is asked to enter how many terms of the series they want to see, and the program prints the series accordingly.

This project helped us understand how to:
Work with loops
Create and use functions
Handle user input
Write clean and simple code

Tools Used :
Python 3.12: The main programming language used for writing the Fibonacci logic.
IDLE (comes with Python) : To write and run the code.

Major Use of the Project
The Fibonacci sequence has many practical applications in mathematics, computer algorithms, and even nature (like the growth pattern of plants or spirals in shells). In programming, it's commonly used for:
Learning recursion and loops
Practicing problem-solving
Building a base for more complex topics like dynamic programming
